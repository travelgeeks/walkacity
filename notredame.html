          <h3>Notre Dame de Paris</h3>

          <p>Notre Dame de Paris was among the first buildings in the world to use the flying buttress (arched exterior supports). 
            The building was not originally designed to include the flying buttresses around the choir and nave but after the 
            construction began, the thinner walls (popularized in the Gothic style) grew ever higher and stress fractures began to 
            occur as the walls pushed outward. In response, the cathedral's architects built supports around the outside walls, and 
            later additions continued the pattern. Many small statues were placed around the outside. These were crafted individually
            and served as supports for columns and water spouts. Among these are the famous gargoyles and chimeras (the former of which 
            is designed to run off rain water). These were originally colored, as was most of the exterior. The paint has worn off, but 
            the grey stone was once covered with vivid colors. The cathedral was essentially complete by 1345. The cathedral has a narrow 
            climb of 387 steps at the top of several spiral staircases; along the climb it is possible to view its most famous bell and its 
            gargoyles in close quarters, as well as having a spectacular view across Paris when reaching the top. The design of St. Peter's
            Cathedral in Adelaide, Australia was inspired by Notre Dame de Paris.</p>
