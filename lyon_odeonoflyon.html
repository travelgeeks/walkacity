          <h3>Odeon of Lyon</h3>
          <p><img src="http://i1310.photobucket.com/albums/s647/skylarian/odeonlyon_zpsd335734c.jpg" width="500" height="400"/></p>
          <p>The Odeon of Lyon is a small ancient Roman theatre near the summit of the Fourvière hill in Lyon, France. 
          It forms a pair with the theatre, one of only two such pairs in Gaul (the other is in Vienne). The building 
          was discovered in the sixteenth century and was wrongly considered at the time as the amphitheater where the 
          Christian martyrs died in Lyon in 177. Sometimes regarded as a theater or auditorium by various authors 
          (Claude Bellièvre, Gabriel Simeoni, Guillaume Paradin), the monument appeared in several texts and plans, and 
          was eventually deemed as a cultural building. The Odeon was built in the early to mid-second century. 
          Archaeologists are reluctant on the date of its construction. The excavators date the building of the same 
          period as the extension of the theater during the reign of Hadrian. It has a 73-meter diameter and a 
          3,000-seat capacity, which justifies its classification as Odeon, i.e. a covered building used for musical 
          performances and public reading, less popular than theater performances. It was also used as meeting room for 
          the notables of the city.</p>
