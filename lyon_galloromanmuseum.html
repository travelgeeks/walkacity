          <h3>Gallo-Roman Museum</h3>
          <p><img src="http://i1310.photobucket.com/albums/s647/skylarian/galloroman_zps6b435a6b.jpg" width="500" height="400"/></p>
          <p>The Gallo-Roman Museum of Lyon is a museum on the Gallo-Roman civilisation in Lyon (Roman Lugdunum), 
          previously located in the heart of the Roman city and now sited near the city's Roman theatre on the Fourvi√®re 
          hill, half-buried into the hillside on the edge of the archaeological site. The new building was designed by 
          Bernard Zehrfuss and opened in 1975. Internally, it is formed of a concrete spiral ramp descending and 
          branching out into the display rooms. It is managed and operated by the Rhone department jointly with the 
          archaeological museum of Saint-Romain-en-Gal. As well as displaying its own permanent collections of Roman, 
          Celtic and pre-Roman material (inscriptions, statues, jewellery, everyday objects), a plan-relief of the 
          ancient town and scale models of its major monuments such as the theatre and the Odeon, it also regularly 
          hosts temporary exhibitions.</p>
