          <p>The Palace of Versailles, is one of the largest and most opulent castles in the world. Boasting around 2,143 windows, 1,252 fireplaces,
          and 67 staircases, the Castle is one of the most visited attractions in France. As a fine example of 18th century French art, this historic
          building has been on UNESCO’s World Heritage List for 30 years. The castle was the official seat of power until 1789, but has since been 
          seen as the unofficial seat. Also known as the “cradle of liberty” (Berceau-de-la-Liberté) it was here that the people of Paris made their 
          stand against King Louis XV1, forcing the Royal Family to leave behind their life of decadence and move back to the true capital city of Paris.
          This stunning historic castle with its beautiful architecture and gardens, and deep history is a must visit sight on a sightseeing trip to Paris.</p>
