          <h3>Merlion Park</h3>
          <p><img src="http://i1310.photobucket.com/albums/s647/skylarian/merlion_zps0b03b644.jpg" width="500" height="400"/></p>
          <p>Merlion Park is located near the Central Business District area of Singapore. There are two structures of 
          the Merlion located at the park with one standing at 8.6 metres which is the original Merlion statue, and a 
          2-metre tall Merlion cub located just behind the original statue.</p>
          <p>The Merlion itself, is a mythical creature with the head of a lion and the body of a fish, used as a mascot 
          and national personification of Singapore. Its name combines "mer" meaning the sea and "lion". The fish body 
          represents Singapore's origin as a fishing village when it was called Temasek, which means "sea town" in 
          Javanese. The lion head represents Singapore's original name — Singapura — meaning "lion city" or "kota singa".
          There are 3 other Merlion statues located at Sentosa, Tourism Court and Mount Faber respectively.</p>
